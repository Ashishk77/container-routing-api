Task 2: Concurrent System Design
1. Problem Statement:
Design a backend architecture that can serve the container-routing optimization API under heavy concurrent load, ensuring low latency and graceful degradation, taking into account port constraints like variable arrival rates, berth limits, and priority rules.

2. Solution Approach:
The backend needs to scale efficiently under heavy concurrent load. The following components are key for handling such load and maintaining low latency:

Load Balancer: Distributes requests evenly across API servers to prevent any single server from being overloaded.

Cache: Stores previously computed routing plans to reduce re-computation and lower response times.

Datastore: Holds long-term data like container locations, historical move plans, and other metadata.

API Servers: Handles requests and applies the optimization algorithm.

Monitoring & Alerts: Tracks the performance of the system and triggers alerts if any part of the system fails or starts to degrade.

4. Key Components:
Load Balancer:

Use NGINX or HAProxy for routing traffic across API servers.

Supports failover, retry mechanisms, and load distribution.

Cache Layer:

Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed optimization plans.

Cache miss will trigger a request to the API servers to perform the optimization.

API Servers:

Implemented using FastAPI for handling optimization requests.

The servers can be scaled horizontally to meet the traffic demands.

Datastore:

A NoSQL database like MongoDB or a SQL database like PostgreSQL to store persistent data.

Data like container status, move history, etc., can be stored and queried as required.

Monitoring & Logs:

Prometheus for system monitoring and Grafana for visualizing performance metrics.

Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) stack for logging and monitoring errors.

5. Scalability and Failure Handling:
Horizontal Scaling:

API servers can scale horizontally based on incoming traffic. If traffic increases, additional API servers can be spun up to handle more requests.

Graceful Degradation:

In case of high load or failure, the system can serve cached results for some requests, ensuring that the system doesn't go down completely.

Failover Mechanisms:

If an API server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to healthy instances.

Cache layer replication ensures high availability.

Auto-Scaling:

Cloud-based solutions like AWS Auto Scaling or Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can automatically scale the API servers based on the load.

6. Conclusion:
This architecture ensures that the optimization API can handle high concurrency, maintain low latency, and degrade gracefully under load. Horizontal scaling, load balancing, caching, and auto-scaling ensure that the system can serve requests efficiently while handling failures seamlessly.
